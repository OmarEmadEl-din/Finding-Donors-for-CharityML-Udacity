# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML-Udacity
CharityML is a hypothetical charitable organisation based in the heart of Silicon Valley that was founded to give financial assistance to persons interested in learning machine learning. CharityML concluded that every gift they got came from someone making more than $50,000 per year after sending approximately 32,000 letters to residents in the region. CharityML has opted to send letters to California citizens, but only those who are most likely to give to the charity, in order to broaden their prospective donation base. With over 15 million Californians working. My objective here will be to assess and optimise a variety of supervised learners in order to identify which algorithm would deliver the best contribution return while also minimising the overall number of letters sent.
